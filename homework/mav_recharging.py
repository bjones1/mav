# mav_recharging.py - Simulate a multi-MAV recharging station
# ***********************************************************
# A group of *n* MAVs each carry out a mission by taking off, flying along a directed path, then landing when the mission is complete. They land at a charging station, which is a circle with a series of electrodes evenly distributed around it. The MAVs then connect to two electrodes, charge, then take off to complete their next mission.
#
# Your task is to simulate the charging station's operation. When an MAV lands, it will reqest two electrodes from the charging station; when both are given, it charges, releases the electrodes, then takes off again. You must insure that a given electrode is only granted to one MAV at a time.
#
# Each MAV should be simulated by a class which runs in a unique thread, making charging requests of the station..

# What I want: a set of unique identifiers that will be named nicely,
# rather than printed as a number. Really, just a way to create a class whose
# members contain a string representation of their name. Perhaps the best
# solution is `enum34 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34>`_, based on `PEP
# 0435 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0435/>`_, but I don't want an extra
# dependency just for this.
